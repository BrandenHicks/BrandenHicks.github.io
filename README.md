During my senior year I was tasked with creating a responsive web page with the use of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I deciding to create a basic quiz application sense I had a limited understanding on how to use Javascript. The quiz uses a prompt to record the user's name (or the name they choose to use), then proceeeds to ask the user 3 questions. These questions are multiple choice and tallies a score based on if the users answered correctly or not. The programs uses basic algorithms and conditional statements to function. In order to pass the test, the user would need to answer at least 2 questions correctly. At the end the user will receieve a different message on the webpage depending on if they passed or not.
